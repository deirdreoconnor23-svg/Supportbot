# VPN Troubleshooting Guide

## VPN Connection Drops Every 30 Minutes

### Symptoms
- User reports VPN disconnects approximately every 30 minutes
- Affects Windows 10 and Windows 11 machines
- Often occurs after Windows updates

### Root Cause
Windows power management settings can disable network adapters to save power, interrupting VPN connections.

### Resolution Steps

1. Open Device Manager (right-click Start > Device Manager)
2. Expand "Network adapters"
3. Right-click your network adapter > Properties
4. Go to "Power Management" tab
5. Uncheck "Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power"
6. Click OK and restart

### If Issue Persists

Check the VPN client idle timeout settings:
- Open VPN client configuration
- Look for "Idle Timeout" or "Session Timeout"
- Increase value or set to 0 (no timeout)

## VPN Authentication Failures

### Symptoms
- "Authentication failed" error
- User credentials rejected despite correct password

### Common Causes
1. Password recently changed - VPN client cached old credentials
2. Certificate expired
3. MFA token sync issue

### Resolution

For cached credentials:
1. Open Credential Manager (Windows search > "Credential Manager")
2. Select "Windows Credentials"
3. Find VPN-related entries
4. Remove them
5. Reconnect and enter new password

For certificate issues:
- Check certificate expiry: certmgr.msc
- Request new certificate from IT Security if expired

For MFA issues:
- Resync authenticator app
- Contact helpdesk for MFA reset if needed

## VPN Slow Performance

### Diagnostic Steps

1. Run speed test WITHOUT VPN connected
2. Run speed test WITH VPN connected
3. Compare results

### If VPN Speed is Less Than 50% of Normal

Check for split tunneling:
- Traffic to internal resources should go through VPN
- Internet traffic should go direct (if policy allows)

Check VPN server load:
- Try connecting to different VPN gateway
- Peak hours (9-10am, 2-3pm) often have congestion

Check MTU settings:
- Open Command Prompt as admin
- Run: netsh interface ipv4 set subinterface "Local Area Connection" mtu=1400 store=persistent
